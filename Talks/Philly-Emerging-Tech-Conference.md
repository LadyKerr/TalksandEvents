## Abstract: 

Did you know that you could order a pizza and send a text message with GitHub Actions? While Github Actions is the perfect tool for automating all aspects of your software workflows and deployment processes, you can also use actions to automate and streamline a variety of tasks. Whether you're looking to compress images for the web, generate semantic release notes or check if your team member is awake - there's an action for that! 

This talk explores how to get started with Github Actions, novel ways developers use actions to increase their productivity, and future enhancements the GitHub team is working on.
